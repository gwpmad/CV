## George Maddocks

Following various roles that involved working with developers, I've decided to become one myself! A product of the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) bootcamp, I've become skilled at test-driven, object-oriented development. I'm looking for a junior developer role where I can hone what I've learned and have fun with it! I'd love to work in an agile environment where code quality is valued and personal development is encouraged.

## Skills

#### An experienced, effective team member

I have proved myself to be a valuable member of the team in a number of different fields.
- A fast learner: in my previous role at GroupM, WPP's media buying operation, I became an operational expert on the group's shared Metis media buying system.
- A very strong written communicator, as well as verbally: I have blogged on tech topics and written marketing copy for Investis, a corporate website company, and, separately, acted as an ambassador for the Metis system at various GroupM agencies. These endeavours both required the ability to communicate concisely about technical topics.
- Experience within an agile environment: I worked alongside an agile development team, liaising with developers and a product manager about system bugs and new features.


#### JavaScript

Started using it at Makers Academy and now can't get enough.

- Confident with and competent at using the language within a web application context, as well as on its own. Familiar with frameworks like AngularJS, NodeJS and testing resources like Jasmine ([example](https://github.com/gwpmad/bowling-challenge/blob/master/spec/frameSpec.js)), Protractor ([example](https://github.com/gwpmad/todo_challenge/blob/master/e2e/toDoListFeature.js)) and Karma ([example](https://github.com/gwpmad/github-profile/blob/master/test/searchfactory.spec.js)).
- Worked on a number of different team and solo projects with a Javascript focus.

#### Ruby

Highly familiar with Ruby and the best practices associated with it. I learned the Makers Academy Wayâ„¢, an assurance of quality.

- Experience with using server-side Ruby to craft web applications with MVC structure
- Familiar with and observant of key object-oriented programming principles
- Place an emphasis on test-driven development
- [High Codewars score](http://www.codewars.com/users/gwpmad), largely based upon Ruby code challenges
